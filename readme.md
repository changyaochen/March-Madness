# Predicting the results of 2017 March Madness

This project is hosted by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/march-machine-learning-mania-2017), which provides the initial data. The goal is to predict the outcome of the all the 2278 (=68\*67/2, there are 68 teams in the NVAA tourament) matches. Then given the initial position of the braket, one can proceed to fill-out the braket and predict the champion. Let's cut to the chase, I have UCLA as my 2017 champion, and below is the detailed braket. As of 4/4/2017, I was quite wrong...

Even my prediction doesn't work out quite well, let me elaborate my procedures anyway.
